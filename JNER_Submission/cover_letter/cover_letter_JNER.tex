\opening{Dear Editors,}
On behalf of my coauthors, I am pleased to submit our manuscript entitled
\textbf{“Biohybrid Cochlear Implants: Neural Interfaces, Regenerative Pathways, and Translational Benchmarks”}
for consideration as a \emph{Topical Review} in the \emph{Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation}.
This review synthesizes current knowledge at the intersection of auditory neuroscience, regenerative medicine, and neural interface engineering. Specifically, we highlight: (i) the electrode–neuron gap; (ii) the microanatomy of the Canaliculi Perforantes of Schuknecht (CPS); (iii) biomaterial interfaces (conductive polymers, hydrogels, zwitterionic coatings); (iv) neurotrophin and cell-based strategies; and (v) enabling acoustofluidics (SAW) and sensing concepts.
We confirm the work is original, not under consideration elsewhere, and approved by all authors. We have no conflicts of interest to declare.
We believe the review fits squarely within JNER’s aims and scope, bridging neuroscience, rehabilitation, and engineering. Thank you for your consideration.
\closing{Sincerely,}
\vspace{1em}
