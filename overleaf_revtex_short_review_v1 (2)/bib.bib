  abstract = {Although cochlear implant (CI) technology has allowed for the partial restoration of hearing over the last few decades, persistent challenges (e.g., poor performance in noisy environments and limited ability to decode intonation and music) remain. The “electrode–neuron gap” is inherent to these challenges and poses the most significant obstacle to advancing past the current plateau in CI performance. We propose the development of a “neuro-regenerative nexus”—a biological interface that doubly preserves native spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) while precisely directing the growth of neurites arising from transplanted human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived otic neuronal progenitors (ONPs) toward the native SGN population. We hypothesized that the Polyhedrin Delivery System (PODS®-recombinant human brain-derived neurotrophic factor [rhBDNF]) could stably provide the adequate BDNF concentration gradient to hPSC-derived late-stage ONPs to facilitate otic neuronal differentiation and directional neurite outgrowth. To test this hypothesis, a finite element model (FEM) was constructed to simulate BDNF concentration profiles generated by PODS®-rhBDNF based on initial concentration and culture device geometry. For biological validation of the FEM, cell culture experiments assessing survival, differentiation, neurite growth direction, and synaptic connections were conducted using a multi-chamber microfluidic device. We were able to successfully generate the optimal BDNF concentration gradient to enable survival, neuronal differentiation toward SGNs, directed neurite extension of hPSC-derived SGNs, and synaptogenesis between two hPSC-derived SGN populations. This proof-of-concept study provides a step toward the next generation of CI technology. Statement of significance: Our study demonstrates that the generation of in vitro neurotrophin concentration gradients facilitates survival, neuronal differentiation toward auditory neurons, and directed neurite extension of human pluripotent stem cell-derived auditory neurons. These findings are indispensable to designing a bioactive cochlear implant, in which stem cell-derived neurons are integrated into a cochlear implant electrode strip, as the strategy will confer directional neurite growth from the transplanted cells in the inner ear. This study is the first to present the concept of a “neuro-regenerative nexus” congruent with a bioactive cochlear implant to eliminate the electrode-neuron gap the most significant barrier to next-generation cochlear implant technology.},

This study aims to investigate the long-term efficacy of dexamethasone eluting cochlear implant and locally delivered dexamethasone, a potent anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid on the intracochlear FBR and electrical impedance post-implantation in a murine model and human subjects. The left ears of CX3CR1+/GFP Thy1+/YFP (macrophage-neuron dual reporter) mice were implanted with dexamethasone-eluting cochlear implants (Dex-CI) or standard implant (Standard-CI) while the right ear served as unoperated control. Another group of dual reporter mice was implanted with a standard CI electrode array followed by injection of dexamethasone in the middle ear to mimic current clinical practice (Dex-local). Mouse implants were electrically stimulated with serial measurement of electrical impedance. Human subjects were implanted with either standard or Dex-CI followed by serial impedance measurements. Dex-CI reduced electrical impedance in the murine model and human subjects and inflammatory FBR in the murine model for an extended period. Dex-local in the murine model is ineffective for long-term reduction of FBR and electrode impedance. Our data suggest that dexamethasone eluting arrays are more effective than the current clinical practice of locally applied dexamethasone in reducing FBR and electrical impedance.},

  journal = {J. Biomed. Mater. Res. A},
  pages = {241--250},
  publisher = {Wiley},
  abstract = {Release of neurotrophin-3 (NT3) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from hair cells in the cochlea is essential for the survival of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Loss of hair cells associated with a sensorineural hearing loss therefore results in degeneration of SGNs, potentially reducing the performance of a cochlear implant. Exogenous replacement of either or both neurotrophins protects SGNs from degeneration after deafness. We previously incorporated NT3 into the conducting polymer polypyrrole (Ppy) synthesized with para-toluene sulfonate (pTS) to investigate whether Ppy/pTS/NT3-coated cochlear implant electrodes could provide both neurotrophic support and electrical stimulation for SGNs. Enhanced and controlled release of NT3 was achieved when Ppy/pTS/NT3-coated electrodes were subjected to electrical stimulation. Here we describe the release dynamics and biological properties of Ppy/pTS with incorporated BDNF. Release studies demonstrated slow passive diffusion of BDNF from Ppy/pTS/BDNF, with electrical stimulation significantly enhancing BDNF release over 7 days. A 3-day SGN explant assay found that neurite outgrowth from explants was 12.3-fold greater when polymers contained BDNF (p < 0.001), although electrical stimulation did not increase neurite outgrowth further. The versatility of Ppy to store and release neurotrophins, conduct electrical charge, and act as a substrate for nerve-electrode interactions is discussed for specialized applications such as cochlear implants.}

This article systematically analyses the impact of coating platinum (Pt) electrodes with the conducting polymer poly(ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) doped with a series of common anions which have been explored for neural interfacing applications. Nanoindentation was used to determine the coating modulus and it was found that the polymer stiffness increased as the size of the dopant ion was increased, with PEDOT doped with polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) having the highest modulus at 3.2 GPa. This was more than double that of the ClO4 doped PEDOT at 1.3 GPa. Similarly, the electrical properties of these materials were shown to have a size dependent behavior with the smaller anions producing PEDOT films with the highest charge transfer capacity and lowest impedance. Coating stiffness was found to have a negligible effect on in vitro neural cell survival and differentiation, but rather polymer surface morphology, dopant toxicity and mobility is found to have the greatest impact.},

It is necessary to develop new materials with low interface impedance and large charge transfer capacity for this application and we explore the use of conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) for the same. We subjected PEDOT coated electrodes to voltage cycling between -0.6 and 0.8 V, 24 h continuous biphasic stimulation at 3 mC/cm² and accelerated aging for four weeks. Characterization was performed using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and voltage transient measurements. We found that PEDOT coated electrodes showed a charge injection limit 15 times higher than Platinum Iridium (PtIr) electrodes and electroplated Iridium Oxide (IrOx) electrodes when using constant current stimulation at zero voltage bias. In vivo chronic testing of microelectrode arrays implanted in rat cortex revealed that PEDOT coated electrodes show higher signal-to-noise recordings and superior charge injection compared to PtIr electrodes.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyse the temporal bones and implant of the first University of Melbourne's (UOM) patient (MC-1) to receive the multi-channel cochlear prosthesis. METHODS: The left cochlea was implanted with the prototype multi-channel cochlear prosthesis on 1 August 1978, and the Cochlear versions CI-22 and CI-24 on 22 June 1983 and 10 November 1998, respectively. MC-1 died in 2007. RESULTS: Plain X-rays of the temporal bones showed that after the CI-22 had been explanted seven electrode bands remained in situ. Micro-CT scans also revealed a partially united fracture transecting the left implanted and right control cochleae. Histology indicated a total loss of the organ of Corti on both sides, and a tear of the left basilar membrane. In addition, there was a dense fibrous capsule with heterotopic bone surrounding one proximal band of the CI-22 array that restricted its removal. This pathology was associated with dark particulate material within macrophages, probably due to the release of platinum from the electrode bands. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed possible corrosion of platinum and surface roughening. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the cochlear histology demonstrated the position of the electrode tracts (C1-22 and CI-24) in relation to the spiral ganglion, which showed 85-90\% loss of ganglion cells. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms our first histopathological findings that our first free-fitting banded electrode array produced moderate trauma to the cochlea when inserted around the scala tympani of the basal turn. The difficulty in extraction was most likely due to one band being surrounded by an unusually large amount of fibrous tissue and bone, with an electrode band caught due to surface irregularities. Some surface corrosion and a small degree of platinum deposition in the tissue may also help explain the outcome for this long-term cochlear implantation.},

  abstract = {This study measured changes in electrode impedance over time in 19 adults and 29 children implanted with the Nucleus 24 cochlear implant system, using common ground and three monopolar modes of stimulation, over a series of time intervals. Impedances increased from the intraoperative to the initial fitting session, decreased during the initial fitting session and for the following week, and were then stable. Impedances were lowest for the common ground mode, while for the monopolar modes, impedances were related to the surface area of the return electrode. Impedances for children were higher than those for adults at the initial fitting session and for the following three weeks. The clinically measured impedance values increased in a basal-to-apical direction. When these data were corrected for differences in electrode surface area, impedances decreased in a basal-to-apical direction. Impedances were influenced by whether the electrodes were stimulated or unstimulated. Adults with higher electrode impedances tended to have lower hearing thresholds and comfortable listening levels, but this did not appear to clearly be the case for children.}

  abstract = {Acoustofluidic technologies utilize acoustic waves to manipulate fluids and particles within fluids, all in a contact-free and biocompatible manner. Over the past decade, acoustofluidic technologies have enabled new capabilities in biomedical applications ranging from the precise patterning of heterogeneous cells for tissue engineering to the automated isolation of extracellular vesicles from biofluids for rapid, point-of-care diagnostics. In this Primer, we explain the underlying physical principles governing the design and operation of acoustofluidic technologies and describe the various implementations that have been developed for biomedical applications. We aim to demystify the rapidly growing field of acoustofluidics and provide a unified perspective that will allow end users to choose the acoustofluidic technology that is best suited for their research needs. The experimental set-ups for each type of acoustofluidic device are discussed along with their advantages and limitations. In addition, we review typical types of data that are obtained from acoustofluidic experiments and describe how to model different forces acting on particles within an acoustofluidic device. We also discuss data reproducibility and the need to establish standards for the deposition of data sets within the field. Finally, we provide our perspective on how to optimize device performance and discuss areas of future development.},

  abstract = {The cochlea{\textquoteright}s capacity to decode sound frequencies is enhanced by a unique structural arrangement along its longitudinal axis, a feature termed {\textquoteleft}tonotopy{\textquoteright} or place coding. Auditory hair cells at the cochlea{\textquoteright}s base are activated by high-frequency sounds, while those at the apex respond to lower frequencies. Presently, our understanding of tonotopy primarily hinges on electrophysiological, mechanical, and anatomical studies conducted in animals or human cadavers. However, direct in vivo measurements of tonotopy in humans have been elusive due to the invasive nature of these procedures. This absence of live human data has posed an obstacle in establishing an accurate tonotopic map for patients, potentially limiting advancements in cochlear implant and hearing enhancement technologies. In this study, we conducted acoustically-evoked intracochlear recordings in 50 human subjects using a longitudinal multi-electrode array. These electrophysiological measures, combined with postoperative imaging to accurately locate the electrode contacts allow us to create the first in vivo tonotopic map of the human cochlea. Furthermore, we examined the influences of sound intensity, electrode array presence, and the creation of an artificial third window on the tonotopic map. Our findings reveal a significant disparity between the tonotopic map at daily speech conversational levels and the conventional (i.e., Greenwood) map derived at close-to-threshold levels. Our findings have implications for advancing cochlear implant and hearing augmentation technologies, but also offer novel insights into future investigations into auditory disorders, speech processing, language development, age-related hearing loss, and could potentially inform more effective educational and communication strategies for those with hearing impairments.Significance Statement The ability to discriminate sound frequencies, or pitch, is vital for communication and facilitated by a unique arrangement of cells along the cochlear spiral (tonotopic place). While earlier studies have provided insight into frequency selectivity based on animal and human cadaver studies, our understanding of the in vivo human cochlea remains limited. Our research offers, for the first time, in vivo electrophysiological evidence from humans, detailing the tonotopic organization of the human cochlea. We demonstrate that the functional arrangement in humans significantly deviates from the conventional Greenwood function, with the operating point of the in vivo tonotopic map showing a basal (or frequency downward) shift. This pivotal finding could have far-reaching implications for the study and treatment of auditory disorders.Competing Interest StatementC.A.B. serves as a consultant for Advanced Bionics, Cochlear Ltd., Envoy, and IotaMotion and has equity interest in Advanced Cochlear Diagnostics.

  abstract = {While separating sounds into frequency components and subsequently converting them into patterns of neural firing, the mammalian cochlea processes signal components in ways that depend strongly on frequency. Indeed, both the temporal structure of the response to transient stimuli and the sharpness of frequency tuning differ dramatically between the apical and basal (i.e., the low- and high-frequency) regions of the cochlea. Although the mechanisms that give rise to these pronounced differences remain incompletely understood, they are generally attributed to tonotopic variations in the constituent hair cells or cytoarchitecture of the organ of Corti. As counterpoint to this view, we present a general acoustic treatment of the horn-like geometry of the cochlea, accompanied by a simple 3-D model to elucidate the theoretical predictions. We show that the main apical/basal functional differences can be accounted for by the known spatial gradients of cochlear dimensions, without the need to invoke mechanical specializations of the sensory tissue. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that through its functional resemblance to an ear horn (aka ear trumpet), the geometry of the cochlear duct manifests tapering symmetry, a felicitous design principle that may have evolved not only to aid the analysis of natural sounds but to enhance the sensitivity of hearing.},

abstract = {Modulation of the immune system has gained significant attention in regenerative medicine. Although most tissues possess intrinsic self-repair capabilities, large-sized defects and complex pathological conditions may still lead to tissue microenvironment imbalance and repair failure. Researchers have applied macrophage-mediated immunotherapeutic strategies to various injured tissue repairs by modulating inflammatory responses, intercellular communication, and multitissue synergies to restore immune microenvironmental homeostasis and promote tissue regeneration. Ongoing advancements in materials science have highlighted the precise immunomodulatory role of biomaterials, with passive targeting strategies based on the material's physicochemical properties and active targeting strategies based on specific molecular modifications becoming increasingly important in research. This review focuses on the mechanisms of action of actively and passively targeted biomaterials to modulate macrophages, which improve the tissue regenerative microenvironment through four basic strategies: (i) modulation of the inflammatory response to remove damaged cells, cellular debris, and pathogens; (ii) remodeling of the extracellular matrix; (iii) reconstruction of vascular tissues; and (iv) macrophage-stem cell crosstalk. This review covers the major mechanisms of macrophage action in the regeneration of injured tissues, while exploring the multiple methods by which advanced biomaterials target macrophages and highlighting their applications in the regeneration of a wide range of tissue injuries. We further discuss the future directions and current limitations in the development of biomaterials for macrophage modulation, aiming to advance biomaterials targeting macrophages, realize the full potential of immunotherapy, and achieve precision medicine.}

abstract = {Injured peripheral nerve tissue could benefit from biomaterial nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) that are designed to promote neuronal regeneration. Nerve regeneration is a complex multi-step process that involves the remodeling of the ECM surrounding the regenerating neural tissue. Hydrogel biomaterials have been used as provisional matrices to regulate this regeneration process by providing the desired physical properties and controllable degradation characteristics. The purpose of this investigation was to understand the mechanism by which nerve cells penetrate into a hydrogel made from PEGylated fibrinogen. In this context, the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) assay was used as an in vitro model to study the cellular invasion behavior of both neural and nonneuronal cells. Our hypothesis stipulated that DRG cells employ matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in order to degrade the dense hydrogel matrix and penetrate the biomaterial. Three dimensional (3D) DRG-hydrogel constructs were cultured with MMP inhibitors (MMPi) and the effect of the inhibitors on DRG cell outgrowth was investigated. We also examined the effect of inhibitors on two dimensional (2D) DRG cell outgrowth on PEGylated fibrinogen hydrogels and on tissue culture polystyrene (TCP). Our results demonstrate that DRG cell outgrowth into and onto PEGylated fibrinogen hydrogels was inhibited by MMPi and that the outgrowth characteristics was dependent on the type of inhibitor and its concentration. MMP-3i and MMP-8i decreased both neuronal and nonneuronal outgrowth, where MMP-3i had a stronger inhibitory effect on nonneuronal cells. MMP-2/9i, on the other hand, affected the neuronal outgrowth much more than the others. We concluded that MMPs play a central role in the process of DRG cell penetration into PEGylated fibrinogen hydrogels and may also regulate the adhesion, migration and elongation of neuronal cells on the surface of these hydrogel biomaterials.}

abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a complex medical and psychological challenge for which there is no curative therapy currently available. Despite major progress in pharmacological and surgical approaches, clinical trials for SCI patients have been uniformly disappointing thus far as there are many practical and biological issues yet to be resolved. Neuroinflammation is a critical event of the secondary injury phase after SCI, and recent research strategies have focused on modulating the immune response after injury to provide a more favorable recovery environment. Biomaterials can serve this purpose by providing physical and trophic support to the injured spinal cord after SCI. Of all potential biomaterials, functional hydrogels are emerging as a key component in novel treatment strategies for SCI, including controlled and localized delivery of immunomodulatory therapies to drive polarization of immune cells towards a pro-regenerative phenotype. Here, we extensively review recent developments in the use of functional hydrogels as immunomodulatory therapies for SCI. We briefly describe physicochemical properties of hydrogels and demonstrate how advanced fabrication methods lead to the required heterogeneity and hierarchical arrangements that increasingly mimic complex spinal cord tissue. We then summarize potential SCI therapeutic modalities including: (i) hydrogels alone; (ii) hydrogels as cellular or (iii) bioactive molecule delivery vehicles, and; (iv) combinatorial approaches. By linking the structural properties of hydrogels to their functions in treatment with particular focus on immunopharmacological stimuli, this may accelerate further development of functional hydrogels for SCI, and indeed next-generation central nervous system regenerative therapies.}

abstract = {Neural prostheses transduce bioelectric signals to electronic signals at the interface between neural tissue and neural microelectrodes. A low impedance electrode–tissue interface is important for the quality of signal during recording as well as quantity of applied charge density during stimulation. However, neural microelectrode sites exhibit high impedance because of their small geometric surface area. Here we analyze nanostructured-conducting polymers that can be used to significantly decrease the impedance of microelectrode typically by about two orders of magnitude and increase the charge transfer capacity of microelectrodes by three orders of magnitude. In this study poly(pyrrole) (PPy) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanotubes were electrochemically polymerized on the surface of neural microelectrode sites (1250μm2). An equivalent circuit model comprising a coating capacitance in parallel with a pore resistance and interface impedance in series was developed and fitted to experimental results to characterize the physical and electrical properties of the interface. To confirm that the fitting parameters correlate with physical quantities of interface, theoretical equations were used to calculate the parameter values thereby validating the proposed model. Finally, an apparent diffusion coefficient was calculated for PPy film (29.2±1.1×10−6cm2/s), PPy nanotubes (PPy NTs) (72.4±3.3×10−6cm2/s), PEDOT film (7.4±2.1×10−6cm2/s), and PEDOT nanotubes (PEDOT NTs) (13.0±1.8×10−6cm2/s). The apparent diffusion coefficient of conducting polymer nanotubes was larger than the corresponding conducting polymer films.}
