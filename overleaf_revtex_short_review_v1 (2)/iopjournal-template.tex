\begin{abstract}
Cochlear implants restore hearing by directly stimulating auditory neurons, yet a persistent electrodeâ€“neuron gap constrains spatial selectivity and the fidelity of complex listening. This Topical
Review outlines a biohybrid approach that leverages the canaliculi perforantes of Schuknecht to guide neurites toward recording/stimulation sites while enabling localized therapy.

\section{Section title}
Sample text inserted for demonstration. Organize the main text of your article using section headings, and include any equations, figures, tables, lists etc using your preferred \LaTeX\ packages and commands. Example code for a figure and a table is given below, but you do not have to use this format. For general guidance on using \LaTeX , including information on figures, tables, equations and references, please refer to documents such as the \LaTeX\ WikiBook: \href{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX}{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX}.

Note that clarity of presentation is the most important consideration when preparing your article for submission. It is not necessary to format your article in the style used for published articles in the journal.

To make your figures accessible to as many readers as possible, try to avoid using colour as the only means of conveying information. For example, in charts and graphs use different line styles and symbols.
